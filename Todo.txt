Analysis from 1450 to 1485
delete index 1454 because their values are englobed by the previous candlestick
the minimum for the comparisson for first two segments is the Low of 1453
if the prices in between the two segments are below the minimum previously defined, dont marge

for the levels add a end column

for the wafes an array like with 
no

monotonously rising: 	consecutive candles with higher lows up to a candle with a lower or equal high and lower low
monotonously falling: 	consecutive candles with lower highs up to a candle with a higher or equal low and higher high
special at the end of a monotonously period: rising and ending with a higher or equal high green candle with lower low, followed by a red equal high candle: will add two wave parts
same for the opposite direction
new candels which are included the length of the old candle (between low and high) do not count
